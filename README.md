# Movie-API
A web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches data from a movie API. Users can search for movies, view details such as title, poster, rating, and description, and explore trending films. This project demonstrates working with APIs, JSON data, and dynamic content rendering using JavaScript.
